# Mah KSP Playground

Well someone in irc asked if i could share this. So here it is. 

I started a RP-0 career ugh. today. And i am not really good at flying these rockets, but i can code a bit.

krpc does the trick i guess. So here the python code that got my first rocket into orbit (and some sounding rockets)

Pretty unfinished, stage yourself after launch. Also i put the craft files cause why not.
