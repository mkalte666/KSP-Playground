# Mah KSP Playground

Well someone in irc asked if i could share this. So here it is. 

I started a RP-0 career ugh. today. And i am not really good at flying these rockets, but i can code a bit.

krpc does the trick i guess. So here the python code that got my first rocket into orbit (and some sounding rockets)

Pretty unfinished, stage yourself after launch. Also i put the craft files cause why not. 

## running a craft file

cd into the crafts directory, then run the python file. Have the craft active on the launchpad insde ksp! 
The sys.path.append("../../") is there to allow this. Maybe thats ugly. I dont care much tbh. 

## adding a craft

create a new folder under crafts, copy the template.py out of common or create one yourself. Edit it. Hopefully dont explode.
